      In the current digital transformation era, computer vision is developing strongly and achieving many achievements in life. You can see its presence right in your daily life, such as time attendance, automatic stores, QR code scanning, bank account registration, even disease detection. It can be said that Computer Vision is playing an important role and making daily life simpler and saving time and human resources. From the knowledge we learned in class at college and the experiences from the internship company, recognition protocols attracted us with its diversity and practicality. So, we decided to do this project as our graduation essay as a way for us to research and describe Computer Vision which is likely new for us .
